## Our predictions
Chelsea:
I expect to write about 200 LOC and that we will work on this for a total of about 15 hours between the two of us.

Rebecca:
I expect that I will write about 300 LOC and that it will take about 15 hours.

## Design
We have four java classes: Card, Deck, Hand, and Game. The Card class contains the suit, rank, and imageId attributes for each card. The Deck class adds all 52 unique cards to the deck, shuffles the deck, and also deals a card. The Hand class, creates an array of up to 5 cards and updates/stores the points. Finally, the Game class handles each player's turn as well as connects the java code to the app (including displaying the cards to the screen). In addition, we have the MainActivity java class which is responsible for the first screen of the game. The Game class is the activity for the second screen.

## Report

Since this was the first Android app Rebecca has worked on and the most difficult one Chelsea has worked on, we began this project by focusing heavily on the design. After we planned out how we wanted to design the project and a plan as to how to implement it, we began working on the java code. We made a tester to ensure that all of our Java code was functioning properly and that we had implemented all of the requirements of the game. 

After we had completed the java code a week before the due date. We began working on implementing the app. Some steps of this process we were able to complete easily, such as creating a home screen and the button that started the game. At this point, we designed the second screen with the proper buttons that allow the user to restart the game or hit as well as the five face down cards for each the player and the dealer. We struggled with displaying the dealt card to the screen. We are confident that if we got that working that our app would work properly since we tested it with our Tester extensively. 

Our predictions on the number of hours and LOC we would each contribute to the project were underestimations. In total, Rebecca spent about 20 hours on the project and wrote about 650 LOC. Chelsea spent about 17 hours on the project and wrote 500 LOC. Those hours we spent included both time spent researching and time spent coding and debugging.
